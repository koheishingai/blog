### Start your engines

We want to thank our many thousands of private beta users for kicking the tires and providing invaluable feedback for us to continue to make Nitrous.IO the best development platform available. To those of you who haven't yet received invites, we apologize for the delay, but your wait is over!

We've made significant improvements across all parts of the platform, most notably on backend performance and stability. Nitrous.IO is lightning fast! And it's far easier (and cheaper) to create boxes on Nitrous.IO then configuring your own VPS. But don't take our word for it-- we're taking the covers off today, so go sign up and create your first box for free.

For newcomers, here's a brief look at what Nitrous.IO offers you:

### N2O

With our public beta release, we're introducing a new concept for provisioning boxes on the Nitrous.IO platform.

To create and upgrade boxes, you'll need *N2O units* to increase the total memory and storage allocation on your box. 

Memory is available in 128 MB blocks at 40 N2O per block, while Storage is available in 250 MB blocks at 10 N2O per block. Sliders on the create and edit box pages will allow you to upgrade or downgrade the resources accordingly. 

You can play around with how much it would cost for you to create boxes of different memory and storage configurations by visiting our [pricing page](https://www.nitrous.io/pricing).

The minimum resources necessary to create a new box is 384 MB of Memory and 750 MB of storage. This is the equivalent of (3) 128 MB blocks of Memory and (3) 250 MB blocks of Storage. So the total N2O required for a base box is: 

<div class="well">
  (3 * 40 N2O) + (3 * 10 N2O) = **150 N2O**
</div>

### Is it free? 

Many of you have been asking if we'll continue to offer free resources at the end of the private beta. The answer is yes, and in fact, we upgraded the free experience from a base 256 MB box to a 384 MB box. There is no obligation to upgrade, and no credit card required. 

We start every account off with 150 units of N2O. As we demonstrated above, this is the amount required for a box with 384 MB of Memory and 750 MB of storage.

These specs are surprisingly fast, as we do offer burst capabilities depending on system demand. However, for those applications that require more horsepower, we provide ways for you to boost your box.  

### Get more N2O

There are 2 ways to get more N2O. You can purchase blocks of it, or you can earn it by taking certain actions on the site.

*Inviting Users*

When you invite a friend or colleague and they accept the invitation, you will both earn 10 units of N2O. You're able to invite up to 10 users, which can give you a significant boost in resources.

You can visit the invites page through the link in the top navigation. You'll see a unique referral link that you can share on Twitter, Facebook, and any other service.

*Connecting Github, Google and LinkedIn*

Connecting Google and Github streamlines your experience by making signin easier and by making it easier to clone and manage your github repositories. Connecting these accounts gives you an additional 10 N2O.

We'll be adding additional ways to earn N2O in the coming months, so stay tuned. 

### How long does my N2O last? 

Your N2O lasts forever. So let's say you create a base box that requires 150 units of N2O. That box is available indefinitely. When you terminate that box, you'll get the 150 N2O credited back to  your account. 

### More hotness coming soon

We have a number of really powerful features and updates in the works, which we'll be launching over the next few months. We encourage you to stay tuned to [@nitrousio](http://www.twitter.com/nitrousio?intent=follow) on
