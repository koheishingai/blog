### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Miles Smith, and I'm a freelance Ruby/JS developer, working mainly in the video game industry. I build web apps that ingest and analyze vast amounts of data for several organizations and communities of various video games.

### What hardware do you use?

I've been on a MacBook Pro Retina for about a year, and I love it. The screen resolution is second best to the slim(mer) form factor, and the battery life is outstanding for those long international flights where I need to get some work done. Plus, it has the power to play AC3 and launch Kerbal's into space all day long!

### What do you code on Nitrous.IO?

I've worked on Ruby and Node.JS projects for various clients. I've also recently finished one of my own projects, [Minecraft Server List](http://minecraftservers.com/), on Nitrous.IO. It is a dream come true to have the ability to spin up an isolated box with all the prerequisites loaded. Inviting the client's developer/sysadmin into Nitrous.IO to take a look is almost too easy.

### What aspects of Nitrous.IO do you love the most?

The online code editor is the bees knees. It provides me a simple interface into my app's code from anywhere I have an internet connection. The ability to provide a client with my Nitrous.IO dev address so they can see the changes/updates made is  an invaluable tool.

### What is your dream dev environment setup?

I'm really close to it now. As a a freelance developer I'm tasked with working within a customer's sometimes peculiar requests. Nitrous.IO allows me to ensure that my customer's requirements are followed, without interfering with any other projects I may be working on at that time. When I'm ready to scale up a development environment, I use [Cloud66](http://cloud66.com) to take my git repo and deploy it to production systems on Amazon, Digital Ocean, or a customer's own hardware; this allows me to create discrete environments for every client and app all the way through the development to production lifecycle.
