title: Nitrous.IO At Meteor Devshop 3
---

We did a lightning talk at Meteor's Devshop a couple of weeks ago at their San
Francisco office. As you may know, Meteor is a framework that lets you quickly build web applications and we'd written previously about how to setup a [Meteor Dev Environment on Nitrous.IO](http://blog.nitrous.io/2013/02/21/build-meteor-apps-in-the-browser-with-actionio-and-mongolab.html) You can watch the short video here:

It went pretty well and we met some great people and saw some great
demos of Meteor's capabilities. You can read more about it

Thanks to Meteor for inviting us!
