##### An interview with Kevin VanGelder and Jamon Holmgren.

### Who are you and what do you do? 
 
[ClearSight Studio](http://www.clearsightstudio.com/) is a web and mobile app design and development studio based in Vancouver, Washington (just north of Portland, Oregon). We mostly specialize in Rails and RubyMotion and work with some other technologies as well, such as [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/), [Concrete5](http://www.concrete5.org/), [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/), and various other languages and platforms. 

### What hardware do you use?
 
We have a variety of hardware here. It's kind of a "bring whatever device you want" environment. iMacs, MacBooks, a couple Windows PCs, and even two Surfaces are in use at any given point. We try not to be ideological about technology here, unlike some Rails-centric shops. While Jamon (the owner) primarily uses an iMac for development, he also has Windows, Android, and iOS devices.

### What do you code on Nitrous.IO? 
 
Our focus is on Ruby on Rails websites and web applications right now. For RubyMotion, we're restricted to OS X due to the SDK requirements. I'm sure Nitrous.IO is working on Mac boxes :-). But for Rails (which is the majority of our work anyway) we're able to quickly spin up a Rails box and start coding.
 
A couple recent projects we completed using Nitrous.IO would include [Country Restoration](http://www.countryrestoration.com/), a regional construction company website, and a large Rails web application in use by several large, well-known movie production companies. (Since it's an internal system and we're under NDA, we can't say much more, but it was a lot of fun to build). 
 
### What aspects of Nitrous.IO do you love the most? 
 
We were very early adopters for Nitrous.IO. The primary advantage is the ability to work from any device no matter what OS or setup, even if it doesn't run Rails very well locally. This is huge and is what allows us to be so flexible with our development machines. 
 
Another advantage is being able to switch from device to device with no setup time. Last week, Kevin's laptop went down and he was able to switch to his Surface and keep working with no interruptions. Even low powered systems like tablets or netbooks become powerful development machines with Nitrous.IO. 
 
Working remotely is no problem at all. Since Nitrous.IO uses a secure connection, we can plug into any public WiFi and code away without having to worry about security. 
 
One thing we're very excited about is the collaboration features of Nitrous.IO. We're experimenting with remote pair programming and Nitrous.IO makes it very seamless. 
 
### Whatâ€™s your dream dev environment setup?  
 
It would be awesome if we could spin up Postgres or MySQL development instances with a couple clicks on Nitrous.IO. While we currently connect remotely to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) instances, it would be less work if it were integrated right into Nitrous.IO. 
 
But really, with that said, Nitrous.IO is the realization of something we have talked about for years as an ideal workflow. We even sketched out something similar on a whiteboard back in 2011 or so. It was very exciting to hear about Nitrous.IO and we immediately integrated it into our workflow.
