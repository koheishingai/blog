title: Action.IO is now Nitrous.IO
---

It's been awhile since we've last written. If you missed us, we apologize. You're dying to know what we've been up to, we know.

### Nitrous.IO

First thing's first: You may have noticed that we've got a [new name](https://www.nitrous.io). Action.IO was a great name and we loved it as much as you did, but in the interest of not being distracted in the future by giant trademark trolls, we erred on the side of caution and decided to move forward with a new name. Same great service, different URL.

For those who don't know, the word Nitrous comes from Nitrous Oxide, a chemical compound commonly used in motor racing to increase the power output of engines.


### We'll be around for awhile!

Part two: If you were worried that this was a fad, and that we were going to move on to other projects after a few months -- worry no more. Today we announced that we [raised money](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/nitrous-io-seed-funding/) to continue to build and improve Nitrous.IO. We've got an incredible group of investors who have helped build some of the world's most innovative and successful companies. They are incredibly supportive of our vision for Nitrous.IO: To simplify your everyday workflow as a developer.

### Things are fast, really fast

We've put a ton of work into the backend to ensure that your experience is as seamless as possible. Don't take our word for it, here's what a few big-wigs in the tech world had to say about it:

Yehuda Katz, Tilde, Ember.js &amp; Rails core member:

> "Nitrous.IO is insanely good. I was working on Ember in an Ember app! O_O"

Tobias Lutke, CEO Shopify, Rails core alumni:

> "Spent time programming from my web browser thanks to Nitrous.IO This works really really well!"

Tom Dale, Ember.js, Sproutcore:

> "Holy $#!*!; Chromebook Pixel + Nitrous.IO = freaking awesome."

Of course, there's still a ton of work to do and we can't do it alone. Which brings us to our next item of business:

### We're [hiring](https://www.nitrous.io/jobs?ref=blog)!

With the funding, we're looking to expand our [current team](https://www.nitrous.io/jobs). We're hiring [generalist](https://www.nitrous.io/jobs#software) and [dev ops](https:https://www.nitrous.io/jobs#devops) engineers. We have offices in San Francisco and Singapore, but  we're open to remote work and we'll help to relocate you if you're not already in the area.

Last, but certainly not least, we'd like to thank all of our incredible private beta users for helping us improve the platform thus far. We'll be shipping some really amazing new features over the next couple months, as well as continuing to work on ensuring the fastest, most reliable development experience possible.
