Hundreds of you asked for iPad support.  We're not entirely sure why…maybe you're tired of carrying around that mammoth 11" macbook air…or maybe you think it'll impress that cute graphic designer you always see at Starbucks (it won't).  

In any case, we want to make your life more awesome, so we  improved the experience on the iPad.  iPad support is still largely experimental, but its something we'll keep improving, so send us any issues you encounter to [support@nitrous.io](support@nitrous.io). 

### Focus on the Console

Now when you're on the iPad or Android tablet, we provide a shortcut so you can launch a full-screen console immediately for your box.

### Native Keyboard & Softkey Panel

Tapping on the console will automatically open up the native keyboard on your tablet if you don't have a bluetooth keyboard installed.

The virtual keyboard on the iPad was not designed with programming in mind.  So we built a Softkey panel that allows you to enter keys that don't appear on the virtual keyboard. 

There are shortcuts for tab, ctrl, alt, esc, and directional keys which make real development possible using just the virtual keyboard. 

### Tips for an Optimal Experience

* We recommend that you use a bluetooth keyboard for the additional real estate and for full keyboard support. 
* If you have to use a native keyboard on the iPad, the best experience is if you use the split keyboard (where keyboard is on both sides of the screen). 

Remember, this is still in a very rough alpha state, so please send us any issues / feedback so we can continue to improve the experience.  Who knows, maybe in 5 years we'll all be programming on iPads…what do you think?
