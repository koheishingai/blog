### The Benefits of Cloud Development

If you've spun up a development box on [Nitrous.IO](https://www.nitrous.io/), you probably know that there are countless benefits of having a development environment in the cloud.  One of these benefits, is the ability to access a powerful web application runtime (ruby, rails, go, nodejs) from anywhere on any device with a web browser. 

With a cloud development environment, billions of devices are suddenly transformed into powerful software development tools.  We recently profiled how Yehuda Katz develops on a [Chromebook Pixel](http://blog.nitrous.io/2013/08/05/nitrous-stories-i-yehuda-katz-tilde-nitrousio.html). 

While many are skeptical of whether someone can be productive programming on an iPad (or even an iPhone), we couldn't ignore the hundreds of requests we received from users asking for improved iPad support.

We recently took some time to improve the user experience when coding on an iPad.  And while we don't have one in the office to test, we've heard that Android Galaxy tablets work well too.

Please remember, that tablet support on [Nitrous.IO](https://www.nitrous.io) is still largely experimental, but its something we will keep improving -- so send us any issues you encounter to [support@nitrous.io](support@nitrous.io). Here are some of the improvements we made: 

### A Focus on the Console

Now when you're on the iPad or an Android tablet, we provide a shortcut so you can launch a full-screen console immediately for your box.

### Native Keyboard & Softkey Panel

Tapping on the console will automatically open up the native keyboard on your tablet if you don't have a bluetooth keyboard installed.

The virtual keyboard on the iPad was not designed with programming in mind.  So we built a Softkey panel that allows you to enter keys that don't appear on the virtual keyboard.

There are shortcuts for tab, ctrl, alt, esc, and directional keys which make real development possible using just the virtual keyboard.

### Tips for an Optimal Experience

* We recommend that you use a bluetooth keyboard for the additional real estate and for full keyboard support.
* If you have to use a native keyboard on the iPad, the best experience is if you use the split keyboard (where keyboard is on both sides of the screen).

Remember, this is still *alpha*, so please send us any issues / feedback so we can continue to improve the experience.  Who knows, maybe in 5 years we'll all be programming on iPadsâ€¦what do you think?
