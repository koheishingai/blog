title: Nitrous.IO Stories - Michael Bleigh and Divshot

### Who are you and what do you do?

My name is Michael Bleigh, and I'm a Ruby/JS developer and the CEO/cofounder of [Divshot](http://www.divshot.com/). We're building a browser-based front-end development platform that works with Bootstrap, Foundation, and other popular frameworks. Essentially we're creating intuitive visual tools to build web app interfaces without sacrificing professional code quality.

I build and release as much open source as I can. Some of my more popular projects include [OmniAuth](http://www.omniauth.org/), [Grape](http://intridea.github.io/grape/), and more recently [Themestrap](http://code.divshot.com/themestrap/). I get to spend my days making web development better, which is a great job to have.


### What hardware do you use?

I switched to a Chromebook Pixel as my primary machine about a month ago. With the work that I'm doing I wanted to really put my money where my mouth was and see if I could have a web-only workflow. So far, so good!

### What do you code on Nitrous.IO?

I build front-end code using [Divshot](http://www.divshot.com/), but all of my back-end code which includes our API, my Ruby open source projects, and more are now built using Nitrous. I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to run multiple concurrent apps on a single Nitrous box; we have multiple apps that have to run simultaneously for [Divshot](http://www.divshot.com/) and I'm able to run them all on different ports. It took a little wiring up to get started, but now it works great.


### What aspects of Nitrous.IO do you love the most?

I have a development environment ready to go everywhere that I do. If my computer fell out the window, I could borrow one and be up and running again in less than five minutes. I also love the "text editor on top, terminal on the bottom" layout as it lets me run tests, commit, and do other work without changing context too often.


### Whatâ€™s your dream dev environment setup?

I'm getting pretty close with [Divshot](http://www.divshot.com/) up front and Nitrous in the back! Ideally I want an environment that is configured at a single point and usable by the entire team. I would love to be able to create an image for a Nitrous box that could be updated over time and simply duplicated out for each of our developers. It's shocking how much time gets wasted trying to onboard new team members and I think there's huge opportunity there.

The text editor capabilities of Nitrous work surprisingly well, but I have to admit I'm missing a few features from Sublime Text. I would love to see user-created extensions as a feature of the editor. Barring that, I would love a fuzzy finder and better search/replace capabilities.
